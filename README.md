#### Things I know a bit of

#### More stuff

- Why sudwind? -- I like German, I am located in south america, and I just wanted something that sounded cool I guess.

- Why some repos have references to Japanese stuff? -- Because I like Japanese culture and because sometimes it's just easier to remember.

- You worked on Android open source before, will you work back on it? -- It depends, I originally worked on it because my devices were already outdated and underpowered when I bought them, ever since I got what I consider a powerful enough device I just never felt the need to go back to it. However, I currently have a Moto Edge 20 Pro, and I don't seem to find many custom ROMs for it.
